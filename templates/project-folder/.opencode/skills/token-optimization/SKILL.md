# Token Optimization

## Why This Matters

Token waste compounds. A session that reads 5 files unnecessarily at startup costs
those tokens on every single session for the life of the project. Over 100 sessions
that is a significant drain on daily limits and a meaningful cost in paid plans.

Three Man Team addresses token waste structurally — the rules fire automatically,
not as a reminder you might follow.

## The Five Rules

```
Is this in a skill or memory?   → Trust it. Skip the file read.
Is this speculative?            → Kill the tool call.
Can calls run in parallel?      → Parallelize them.
Output > 20 lines you won't use → Route to subagent.
About to restate what user said → Delete it.
```

## RTK — Bash Output Compression

Token optimizer controls how the team thinks, reads, and responds. RTK handles what
comes back from bash commands.

[RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) is a separate tool that compresses bash command
output before it hits the agent's context window. Tools like `find`, `ls`, and `grep` can
return hundreds of lines the agent doesn't need — RTK intercepts that output and compresses
it, often cutting 50-70% of bash output tokens automatically.

RTK is not part of Three Man Team and we don't manage it. Install it separately if you
use opencode heavily. The combination of RTK (bash layer) + token-optimizer
(behavior layer) is where the real savings compound.

## Grep Before Read

Never read an entire file to find one thing. Grep for the exact string or line number
first. If you need context around it, use offset and limit on the Read. This single
rule has the highest impact in active build sessions.

## Role-Scoped Loading

Each role loads only what their job requires:
- Architect: checkpoint + BUILD-LOG + ARCHITECT-BRIEF
- Builder: ARCHITECT-BRIEF + relevant reference files only
- Reviewer: REVIEW-REQUEST + specific files Builder listed

The full project spec, schema, and flow docs stay on disk until explicitly needed.

## Checkpoint-First

SESSION-CHECKPOINT.md replaces reading BUILD-LOG and the full spec when it is current.
Architect writes it at the end of every session. It should cover: where we stopped,
what was decided, what is open, and the exact resume prompt.

## opencode.json as Router

opencode.json and the .opencode/ directory are routing infrastructure, not a knowledge base.
Every byte in instructions costs tokens on every session. Keep it lean.
